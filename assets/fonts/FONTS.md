# Bundled fonts

These fonts are embedded into the Aggrega binary at build time (see `ui/theme.slint`).
They came from [Bunny Fonts](https://fonts.bunny.net) (Latin subset, WOFF), and were
converted losslessly to TTF. Outline data and name tables are unchanged.

| Files | Family | Copyright | License |
|---|---|---|---|
| `source-serif-4-*.ttf` (400, 400 italic, 600, 700, 900) | Source Serif 4 | © 2014–2021 Adobe Systems Incorporated, with Reserved Font Name "Source" | SIL Open Font License 1.1 |

The SIL Open Font License 1.1 is available at <https://openfontlicense.org>.
It allows these fonts to be bundled and redistributed with software. You may not sell
them by themselves, and any modified version must not use the Reserved Font Names.

The full OFL text, with both copyright notices, is in [`OFL.txt`](OFL.txt). It ships with
every release package, and the About tab in Settings repeats the notices (the converted
files' name tables carry no copyright string of their own).
