# Release Aggrega

Pushing a tag matching `v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+*` triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`. It builds in an `archlinux` container, rewrites the `[package]` version in `Cargo.toml` from the tag (that's what the sidebar shows), and uploads `aggrega-<version>-x86_64.tar.gz` as a workflow **artifact**. It does not create a GitHub Release.

## 1. Pick the version

- List existing tags with `git tag --sort=-v:refname | head`. The new version must be higher than the latest one.
- If the user didn't give a version, propose one from the commits since the last tag (`git log <last-tag>..main --oneline`): patch for fixes, minor for features. Wait for them to confirm.

## 2. Check `main`

- Be on `main`, up to date with `origin/main`, with a clean working tree.
- Run the `precheck` skill. Don't tag if it fails.
- Check that the latest CI run on `main` passed: `gh run list --workflow CI --branch main --limit 1`.

## 3. Don't bump the version in the repo

The Git tag is the only source of truth for release versions. Leave the `version` in `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock` and `pkgver` in `packaging/arch/PKGBUILD` alone. They intentionally lag behind the tags, and the workflow sets the real version inside CI. No release commit is needed.

## 4. Tag and push (confirm first)

Pushing a tag is outward-facing and triggers a public build. Ask the user before running:

```bash
git tag vX.Y.Z
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

## 5. Watch the build and fetch the artifact

```bash
gh run list --workflow "Release build" --limit 1          # get the run id
gh run watch <run-id> --exit-status
gh run download <run-id> --dir <scratch dir>
```

Report the result. On success, give the run URL and the artifact name. On failure, show the failing step's log (`gh run view <run-id> --log-failed`). Don't delete or move the tag without asking the user.
