# Aggrega

**All your feeds, one edition.** Aggrega is a fast, lightweight desktop feed reader with an editorial, magazine-style design. It runs entirely on your machine, with no account and no cloud sync. It's written in Rust with a [Slint](https://slint.dev) UI.

## Features

- **No login, local only.** Your subscriptions and read state live in a single SQLite file on your disk.
- **No telemetry, tracking or analytics.** There is no telemetry, tracking or analytics code in Aggrega. The only network traffic is fetching the feeds, thumbnails and articles you asked for; nothing is reported anywhere.
- **Unlimited sources.** RSS 0.9x/1.0/2.0, Atom and JSON Feed are all supported.
- **Smart "Add source".** Paste a feed URL, or just a website such as `theverge.com`. Aggrega finds the feed from the page's `<link rel="alternate">` tags or from common paths like `/feed` and `/rss.xml`.
- **Newest posts first.** The list merges every source into one feed sorted by date. You can also focus on a single source from the sidebar.
- **Works offline.** Everything you've downloaded, including stories and thumbnails, stays readable without a connection. When no source can be reached, Aggrega says it's offline instead of flagging your sources as broken, and it retries on the next refresh.
- **Refreshes on launch and on demand.** Cached articles show up immediately, and fresh ones are fetched in parallel in the background. Aggrega sends conditional requests (ETag / Last-Modified), so feeds that haven't changed cost almost nothing.
- **Unread highlighting.** Unread stories get a red dot before the kicker and a black-weight headline. Read ones drop to a lighter grey headline with a dimmed photo. Each source shows its unread count. The **Unread** tab is the default view; stories you read there slide out of the list right away. *All* shows everything, and *Mark all as read* clears the view.
- **Reader view.** Clicking an article opens it inside Aggrega as a clean, single-column page with its headline, lead photo, text, quotes, lists and pictures, and marks it as read. When the feed only carries a summary, Aggrega fetches the article's page and pulls out the story, leaving menus, share bars and comments behind. The result is saved, so the story opens instantly next time, even offline. **Read on …** or `O` opens the original in your browser. Hover a story in the list to toggle read/unread without opening it.
- **Thumbnails.** Thumbnails are pulled from the feed's media tags or the article's first image. They are shrunk and cached on disk, and they fade in without blocking the UI.
- **Editorial design.** Newsprint paper and ink colours, heavy serif headlines (Source Serif 4), small-caps kickers in each source's colour (Libre Franklin), hairline rules, and a lead story at the top of the list. The fonts are bundled, so the app looks the same on every machine.
- **Opening sequence.** At launch the masthead is set in about 2.8 seconds and then lifts like a curtain. Click or press any key to skip it.
- **Fits the window.** The layout adapts to the window width. Narrow windows get a slimmer sidebar, tighter margins, smaller headlines and thumbnails, and wide ones cap the column at a comfortable reading width.
- **Custom title bar.** The window has no system frame. Drag the header or the sidebar masthead to move it, double-click to maximise, and resize from any edge.
- **Light and dark themes.** Aggrega follows your desktop by default. The toggle cross-fades the whole UI and remembers your choice.
- **Fluid animations.** Rows glide in, thumbnails zoom gently on hover, headlines turn red, the tab underline and theme switch use spring easing, and a red progress sweep runs while refreshing.

### Keyboard shortcuts

| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| `F5` / `Ctrl+R` | Refresh all sources |
| `Ctrl+N` | Add a source |
| `Enter` | Confirm in the "Add source" dialog |
| `Esc` | Close dialogs, or close the reader |
| `Backspace` / `←` | Back to the list (reader) |
| `↑` / `↓`, `Space` / `Shift+Space`, `PgUp` / `PgDn`, `Home` / `End` | Scroll the article (reader) |
| `O` | Open the original page in your browser (reader) |

## Quick start (Arch Linux)

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel rustup fontconfig freetype2 libxkbcommon wayland libglvnd
rustup default stable
cargo run --release
```

To install it as a proper package, with a launcher entry and icon:

```bash
cd packaging/arch && makepkg -si
```

[docs/BUILDING.md](docs/BUILDING.md) has the full build, run, test and packaging guide, plus troubleshooting.

## Where is my data?

| What | Path |
|---|---|
| Subscriptions, articles, read state, settings | `~/.local/share/aggrega/aggrega.db` |
| Thumbnail cache (safe to delete) | `~/.cache/aggrega/thumbs/` |

Both paths honour `XDG_DATA_HOME` / `XDG_CACHE_HOME`. To start fresh, quit Aggrega and delete the two directories. Read articles older than 90 days are pruned automatically.

## Roadmap ideas

- More build targets (Flatpak, AppImage, Windows, macOS)
- OPML import/export
- Folders/categories, search
- Periodic background refresh
- Next/previous story from the reader

## Licensing

Aggrega doesn't have a license yet. Choose one before you distribute it. Slint itself is available under GPLv3, a royalty-free license for desktop apps (which requires Slint attribution, such as an "About Slint" notice or badge), or a commercial license. Your choice for Aggrega decides which of these you can use. See <https://slint.dev/pricing>.
